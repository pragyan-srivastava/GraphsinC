# Graphs in C

This project is a from-scratch implementation of graph data structures and algorithms in the C programming language. It serves as a learning repository for fundamental to advanced graph theory concepts.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Graph Representations
- **Adjacency Matrix:** For dense graphs.
- **Adjacency List:** For sparse graphs, using linked lists.

### 2. Graph Traversal Algorithms
- **Depth First Search (DFS):** Implemented for both matrix and list representations.
- **Breadth First Search (BFS):** Implemented for both matrix and list representations.

### 3. Core Operations
- Graph creation for both representations.
- Functions to add and remove both **directed** and **undirected** edges.

### 4. Supporting Data Structures
- A custom **Queue** implementation used for the BFS algorithm.
